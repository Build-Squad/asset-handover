# flowsafe dapp

flowsafe was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and serves 2 main views which allow users to interact with the Flow blockchain. Users can create one safe, add their crypto assets to it and choose a recipient, by adding their crypto assets to the safe their are allowing the recipient to withdraw their assets to his wallet once the maturity date of the safe has elapsed, while in the safe, the assets are not actually locked and do not leave the ownership of the owner, this is simply an attempt to delegate ownership at a future date, a digital "will". Users can also view their pledges which are safes that have designated them as recipients and withdraw any assets that those safe's include once the specified maturity date has elapsed.
